Review and improve this Python-based Tally (ERP 9 & Prime) to Zoho Books migration tool across all modules, including Groups, Ledgers, Customers, Vendors, Items, Stock, Taxes, Cost Centers, Invoices, Bills, Receipts, Payments, Credit/Debit Notes, and other Vouchers. The solution should replace all regex-based XML parsing with a robust XML parsing approach (such as ElementTree) to safely handle structural variations, optional tags, and customizations across different Tally versions and client databases. Implement a normalized internal data model for each module so that Tally-specific inconsistencies are isolated from Zoho Books API logic. Add schema-tolerant field extraction with safe defaults and fallbacks for missing, renamed, or legacy fields. Strengthen classification logic (customers, vendors, banks, cash, income, expense, inventory) to work even when groups or ledgers are renamed or customized. Introduce strong data validation and cleanup for GSTIN, tax registration types, states, addresses, amounts, dates, and references before syncing. Add per-record error handling so failures in one record or module do not stop the migration process. Implement detailed logging, reconciliation reports, and audit summaries for created, updated, skipped, failed, and partially migrated records across all modules. Ensure idempotent Zoho Books API operations to prevent duplicates on re-runs and support safe retry mechanisms. The final solution must be version-agnostic, scalable for large datasets, resilient to real-world Tally data inconsistencies, and suitable for repeated client migrations in production environments.


now we want create another module called payment received zoho books and in recipt in tallly , 
like what approach we used in invoice , same like this we needs to front end here also and backend 

that should work all the company
